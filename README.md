## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo package manager
- IPFS node (optional)
- PostgreSQL (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helixcore/helix-core.git
cd helix-core
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Configure the node:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
# Edit config.toml with your settings
```

4. Run the node:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Configuration

The main configuration file (`config.toml`) includes settings for:

- Network configuration
- Consensus parameters
- Storage settings
- API endpoints
- Security parameters

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Code Style

- Follow Rust style guidelines
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting
- Run `clippy` for linting

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `/docs/api` when running the node. It includes:

- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket API
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

## Security

### Security Features
